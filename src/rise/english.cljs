   Translate by replacing the english phrases inside double quotes with the italian
   
   Phrases may be simple strings inside double quotes, or they may have markup for formatting.
   
   If it's a simple string, it may contain placeholders %1, %2, %3 etc.... The site code replaces these with
   something else - usually another simple string or number retrieved from the database. You can move the placeholders
   to wherever they make sense.
   
   If you need to change the markup in square brackets ask gmp26@cam.ac.uk how. The syntax is documented 
   at https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup/wiki/Syntax.
