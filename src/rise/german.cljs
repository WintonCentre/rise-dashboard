   Phrases may be simple strings inside double quotes, or they may have hiccup syntax to include formatting.
   
   If it's a simple string, it may contain placeholders %1, %2, %3 etc.... The site code will replace these with
   something else - usually another simple string retrieved from the database. The replacements cannot contain hiccup markup.
   
   Hiccup syntax (which encloses everything in [square brackets]) cannot contain placeholders."
